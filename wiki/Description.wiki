#summary Main Description of the project

= Abstract =

We have developed an image reconstruction software for ROOT files of PET simulations generated by GATE. The algorithm implemented is the Origin Ensemble (OE) which is based on a fully Bayesian approach to the image estimation problem. It has some important advantages over conventional algorithms, simplicity being one of them.. We expect this open source software to be useful for the community of GATE users and researchers in general.  

= INTRODUCTION =

Our goal with this collaborative project was to develop a   simple and useful tool to reconstruct images from list-mode data files of Monte Carlo simulations of PET acquisitions obtained with GATE [1]. GATE can be used to create large ROOT files that need post-processing, involving the generation of sinograms, repining, and normalization, to convert them into the appropriate formats required by the available open-source reconstruction codes (e.g. STIR [2]). However, the post-processing procedure can be difficult and tedious. GATE users are required to have a significant amount of knowledge about PET data processing and tomographic image reconstruction  to obtain good results. Questions regarding the post-processing of ROOT files and image reconstruction are often asked in the GATE collaboration mailing list [3]. 
Our approach in this work was to develop a software (Fully Bayesian Image 3D Estimation (FBI3D)) that enables image estimation directly from the ROOT files. FBI3D implements the Origin Ensemble (OE) algorithm, proposed by A. Sitek [4,5]. It currently has only a basic set of features, but it will be expanded in the future, and it can be easily adapted to incorporate customizable tools.

= Method =

FBI3D code [6] is written in C++. It contains a set of simple functions that enables the user to 1) read the data in the ROOT file, 2) place each detected coincidence in a voxel in the image along the line of response (LOR), 3) reallocate iteratively the coincidences along their LOR according to a simple probabilistic selection rule, 4) obtain the final image corrected by the sensitivity distribution. The FBI3D code can be compiled and executed as a standalone tool or executed within the CNIN interpreter of ROOT. 
The code was evaluated with simulations based on the Ecat PET System provided in the example folder in GATE  v7.0. A brain phantom with standard FDG distribution [7] was simulated for 3 min filled with a back-to-back 511keV gamma source within air. The simulation took 5.6 hours in 1 CPU (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K @ 3.5GHz). We also performed a normalization simulation. We used a uniform activity distribution in the entire field of view (FOV) filled with 6 Ci of a back-to-back source within air (to avoid attenuation). We simulated a 3h acquisition. This normalization simulation was used for obtaining the sensitivity distribution (based on the detected coincidences coming from each point compared to the number of decays simulated in each point) and the scanner’s geometry.
