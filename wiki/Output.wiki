#summary Description of the output format

= Output files =
   * image_ref.raw - Reference image of emitted decays that were detected in the coincidences of the ROOT file (Not reconstructed). 
   * image_ref_sens_corr.raw - Same as before, but corrected by sensitivity
   * image.raw - Reconstructed image (without sensitivity correction)
   * image_norm.raw - Reconstructed image with sensitivity correction
   * image_norm_med.raw - Reconstructed image with sensitivity correction with median filter applied at the end.

= Format =
   * All images are 75x75x61 voxels, 32bits, little endian.
   * All images are float, except for image.raw (integer)

= Tool for MATLAB =

   The tool fbi3d_raw2mat.m allows converting these images into a .mat file for MATLAB
