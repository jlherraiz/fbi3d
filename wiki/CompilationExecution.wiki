#summary Compilation and Execution of the code

= Within ROOT =

root [0]  .x FBI3D.C+(“file.root”, “norm.root”)

= Outside ROOT =

g++ -w -Wl,--no-as-needed FBI3D.C -o FBI3D.x `root-config --cflags --glibs`

./FBI3D.x  file.root  norm.root

where root-config is a small utility in $ROOTSYS/bin that knows the
right compiler/linker sequence for your machine.
